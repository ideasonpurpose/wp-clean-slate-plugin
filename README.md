# WordPress Clean Slate plugin

#### Version 0.0.1

Clean Slate is experimental plugin which removes all WordPress styles from a site's front end, including all injected block styles. The goal is to provide a clean front-end canvas so theme developers can author against a known base and without unforeseen style conflicts coming from WordPress core.

All admin styles are preserved, so the block editor experience is unchanged.

Exceptions are provided for necessary components like the WordPress admin-bar.

## Other Uses

The plugin may also be useful for revealing where a theme is depending on WordPress injected styles. Adding this to an existing site will likely reveal visual differences where WordPress styles were unexpectedly interacting with the theme's stylesheets.

## Installation

Download the latest zipfile from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ideasonpurpose/wp-clean-slate-plugin/releases), then upload to a development WordPress site.
